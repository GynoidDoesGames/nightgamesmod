It mentions Jewel by name and seems to be alluding to the Games. You doubt one of the other girls wrote it. You should probably show it to Lilly.<br/><br/><i>\"Oh for fuck's sake..\"</i> Lilly sighs, exasperated. <i>\"I thought we'd seen the last of these. I don't know who writes them, but they showed up last year too. I'll have to do a second sweep of the grounds each night to make sure they're all picked up by morning. They have competitors' names on them, so we absolutely cannot let a normal student find one.\"</i> She toys with a pigtail idly while looking annoyed. <i>\"For what it's worth, they do seem to pay well if you do what the note says that night. Do with them what you will.\"</i><br/>";
